## Purpose for making `timeline`

As a software engineer, I wanted to keep track of my journey, e.g.:
- Hard & Soft **Skills** I'm Learning
- **Projects** I've completed
- **Achivements**
- and more...

Hance, let's just make something useful for anyone to use

### Milestones

I cannot make the full app in start. I'm planning to achieve end goal in steps:

1. **Basic** UI:
    - A ReactJS UI
    - Any dev with basic web development knowledge can copy and use
    - User will manually create the timeline and paste images in a folder
    - Then easily create an export and deploy anywhere (like github pages.)
2. **Database** and **API**:
    - Add Database
    - Create an API server
    - So that any dev can simply deploy app on a server
3. **CMS**:
    - A lightweight user login and control panel
    - That allows management of timeline
    - With a quick **export to zip** button.
4. **App**:
    - Deploy as an app
    - For anyone to use without need to register
    - Just make your timeline and export
